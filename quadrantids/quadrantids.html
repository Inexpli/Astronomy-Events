    <h3>Active between December 27, 2020, and January 10, 2021, the Quadrantids peak late at night on Saturday, January 2, and into early Sunday morning in 2021. The moon will be 84% full, so if you go out to watch this meteor shower you might have to struggle with too much moonlight in addition to potentially poor weather. Under the best conditions, you’ll see an average of 25 meteors per hour during the Quadrantids, making it one of the stronger showers of the year. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.</h3>
